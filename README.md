# crud-flask-api

Bringing an update to what I have been doing so far.

- Now using Docker server to run it entirelly, no longer needing it to run locally.
- Improvements to code readability and new endpoints.
- Using Blueprints and MethodViews, meaning the HTTP methods are being worked on separate classes on its own.
- Integrating Marshmallow framework for validation (check Marshmallow documentation for further info), as well as writing schemas.
- Decorating HTTP methods responses using Flask-Smorest.
